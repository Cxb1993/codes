\section*{Numerical solution for 1D heat transfer}
Forward time center in space (FTCS) method was used with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
T_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + \Delta t(\alpha \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2})
\end{equation}

A time step of 0.001 was utilized. Grid independence tests were run at $t =
3500$ and grid independence was achieved at 158 intervals. The steady state was achieved at almost $t = 3000$.
