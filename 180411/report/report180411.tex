\section{2D FVD solver Navier-Stokes using two layers of ghost cells}

\subsection{Ghost cells}
Two layers of ghost cells were implemented in C++ using Finite Volume Method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, as shown in the following figure for a reduced grid size.

    \caption{Figure representing the utilization of two ghost cells around the grid, for grid of reduced size}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Debugging}
Earlier code had a major bug, which  in that it implemented the far-side velocity boundary conditions incorrectly. The corrected velocity boundary conditions in the x and y directions for the far side are given below.

\(u\)-velocity for the east boundary:
\begin{equation}
u_{n_x-3,j} = 0\\
u_{n_x-2,j} = u_{n_x-3,j}
\end{equation}

\(v\)-velocity for the north boundary:
\begin{equation}
v_{i,n_y-3} = 0\\
v_{i,n_y-2} = v_{i,n_y-3}
\end{equation}

This can be understood with the help of the following figure.

    \caption{Representation of the utilization of two ghost cells around the grid, for grid of reduced size}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}
The code was solved for the case of a lid-driven cavity flow in a two-dimensional square box. The results are shown in the following figures.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Ongoing tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculating the virtual force for a cylinder inside a lid-driven cavity
    \item Employ parallel computing by using ultraMPP C++ library to execute the code on parallel cores
    \item Solve cavity-driven flow for 3D
\end{enumerate}
