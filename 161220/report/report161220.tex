\section*{Numerical solution for 2D heat transfer}
A C++ code was written to solve the problem of 2D heat transfer. Forward in time
center in space (FTCS) method was used with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
T_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + \Delta t \alpha(\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2})
\end{equation}

A time step of 0.001 was utilized with 200 grid intervals in both x and y
directions. %Two sets of boundary conditions were considered.

Initial condition was $T_i=25^{\circ}C$.

Boundary conditions for the first case were selected as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T_{xi}=25^{\circ}C$ at $x=0$
\item $T_{xf}=25^{\circ}C$ at $x=L$
\item $T_{yi}=25^{\circ}C$ at $y=0$
\item $T_{yf}=50^{\circ}C$ at $y=L$
\end{enumerate}

% Boundary conditions for the second case were selected as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item $T_{xi}=25^{\circ}C$ at $x=0$
% \item $T_{xf}=50^{\circ}C$ at $x=L$
% \item $T_{yi}=25^{\circ}C$ at $y=0$
% \item $T_{yf}=50^{\circ}C$ at $y=L$
% \end{enumerate}
% The initial condition was kept the same. However, steady state was not achieved
% for the test durations used.
