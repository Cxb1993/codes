		\section*{Grid generating algorithm in C++ and its plot on gnuplot}
		An algorithm was coded in C++ for generating a square grid of $(x, y)$ coordinates with 100 divisions between 0 and 1. The C++ program generated  a \emph{.dat} file with coordinates in column format, separated by spaces and linebreaks. The \emph{.dat} file was used to plot a grid in gnuplot using script in a \emph{.gnu} file format.
		
		The results are shown in the figure below.
